<h5>Mars Society Bangladesh started its journey on July 21, 2016. On that day, the U.S. Embassy organized a reception to host the new international Mars Society chapter and also to welcome home the three Bangladeshi student teams that participated in the Mars Society’s 2016 University Rover Challenge (URC) held at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. Over the years our core team members have changed and we have come up with dedicated, enthusiastic, young minds.<h5>
